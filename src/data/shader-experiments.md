# Shader Experiments

A collection of creative shader effects and visual experiments built with GLSL and Three.js.

## Experiments Include
- Procedural noise patterns
- Ray marching demos
- Post-processing effects
- Particle systems
- Generative art

## Learning Goals
This project served as my deep dive into GPU programming and shader development, exploring the creative possibilities of real-time graphics.
